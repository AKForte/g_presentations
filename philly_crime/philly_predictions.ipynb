    "# Can you predict crime?\n",
    "Yes, since it follows a pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction type 1: Given a place what is the probability that a theft will occur?\n",
    "**Apporach**: Perform geographically weighted logistic regression to generate a surface. This prediction surface depicts what is the likelyhood of theft happening in that place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction type 1a: Given a place, what is the probability for each crime to occur?\n",
    "**Approach**: Perform the regression to generate surfaces for each crime type. Pick that crime which has the max probability of all surfaces. That is the crime most likely to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction type 2: Given a crime, where is it most likely to occur?\n",
    "**Approach**: From the same regression surface, pick the coordinate pair that has the highest likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes:\n",
    "To simply the surface problem, we should generalize into hex bins or polygons.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The prediciton surface is not intelligent as it does not consider any other parameter / feature. It just is a regression\n",
    " - To bring in other features, use a learning algorithm\n",
    " - To enrich features, say with demographic data, we need to aggregate the crime into hex bins and the census data into the same hex bin"
